== Documentation ==

This creates the [10to8booking] tag to embed Sign In Scheduling into the page. Usage:
[10to8booking organisation_id="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"]

Once you've signed up for a free account at [10to8.com](https://10to8.com/signup/?utm_source=wp_plugin&utm_medium=existing_platforms) you will be given your organization ID, a 30-character code, to paste into the [10to8booking] tag.

If you have an existing Sign In Scheduling account, you can find your ID by navigating to "Online Booking > Wordpress Widgets" in the application 

We recommend adding the tag in text mode instead of visual mode to prevent other formatting of the URL being inadvertently added. Support is available at http://support.10to8.com/
